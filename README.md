# Power BI Project: Comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** to analyze a bank's loan portfolio and provide actionable insights. The interactive dashboard developed in this project helps stakeholders track key metrics and make data-driven decisions.

## Business Problem
The bank faced multiple challenges in managing and optimizing its loan portfolio, including:

- Identifying **good vs. bad loans** to improve lending efficiency.
- Monitoring **month-over-month performance** in loan approvals, funded amounts, and repayments.
- Understanding **customer profiles** (e.g., employment, homeownership, and loan purposes) to reduce default risks.
- Analyzing the **distribution of loans by state, term, and grade** to uncover regional and segment-based trends.
- Pinpointing **high-risk categories** based on default rates and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
- Providing an **easy-to-use dashboard** for stakeholders to track KPIs in real time.

## Approach
To address these challenges, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Ensured data accuracy and consistency by handling missing and inconsistent data.

2. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with visual elements like KPI cards, pie charts, and trend lines.
   - Included filters for dynamic analysis by **state, term, grade, loan purpose, and homeownership**.
   - Used drill-through functionality and tooltips for detailed, granular analysis.

3. **Defining KPIs**:
   - Focused on critical metrics such as:
     - **Good Loan Ratio**
     - **Bad Loan Ratio**
     - **Total Funded Amount**
     - **Interest Rates**
     - **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios**

## Key Insights
The analysis revealed the following insights:

- **Good Loans vs. Bad Loans**:
  - **86.2% of loans** were classified as good, with $370.2M funded.
  - **13.8% of loans** were bad, contributing to a $65.5M risk.

- **Top Loan Purposes**:

- **Regional Trends**:
  - Certain states exhibited **higher bad loan ratios**, emphasizing the need for localized strategies.

- **Customer Behavior**:
  - Applicants with **10+ years of employment** and mortgage ownership were the most reliable borrowers.

- **Loan Terms Analysis**:
  - **73.2% of loans** were 36-month terms, showing a preference for shorter repayment durations.

- **Default Risk Factors**:
  - Higher default rates correlated with **DTI ratios above 14%** and loans for discretionary purposes like vacations or weddings.
